# TPS54302 buck module

A compact buck converter for an 11-17 V battery supply. The same PCB supports 5 V or 3.3 V with the component values below. Normal load target: 1 A.

20.32 x 30.48 mm, two layers. Input and output are on opposite short edges. Screw terminals face up; breadboard headers face down.

| Connection, viewed from the top | Positive | Ground |
|---|---|---|
| Input corner pins | J3 | J4 |
| Input screw terminal J1 | Pin 2 | Pin 1 |
| Output corner pins | J5 | J6 |
| Output screw terminal J2 | Pin 1 | Pin 2 |

Both ends are positive-left / ground-right. J7: jumper 1-2 = ON, 2-3 = OFF; no jumper = OFF.
